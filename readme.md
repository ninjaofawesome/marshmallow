== Marshmallow: A Pick-And-Choose CSS framework

I love CSS frameworks because they reduce my setup time for a new project.  However, I don't love that when I use other CSS frameworks that there is so much stuff that comes with it that I have to sift through to locate when I need to customize my project.

Thus, I thought a custom built CSS framework would be super handy.  Inspired by marshmallows (which are simple, sweet and squishy... as well as great for stuffing in your mouth in Chubby Bunny championships), I wanted something that I could strip down to exactly what I wanted, or build up to everything I needed.

== This is an ongoing project.

This project is a labor of love, and will have features added to them periodically.  If you like what you see and want to use it, by all means!  If you like what you see and want to contribute to it, get in touch and we'll make it happen!  Thanks, and enjoy!
